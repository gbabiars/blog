One of the most painful parts about using newer CSS3 features is the amount of prefixed styles that must be written in order to support the wide range of browsers out there.  There are many ways to alleviate this pain, including preprocessor mixins.  One of the best ways I've found to eliminate this altogether is to have the prefix generation automated into your build process.  By moving prefixing to this automation step, we can write more maintainable css that will also be easier to update with future browser changes.

## Automating using Grunt
My build tool of choice is Grunt, particularly because of the large number of task plugins available.  One such plugin is available for automating prefix generation of css, called [grunt-autoprefixer](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer).  To make use of it, we simply need to point to the files we want to generate and the prefixed css will be generated.

Our Grunt snippet:
{% codeblock lang:js %}
autoprefixer: {
    options: {
        browsers: ['last 2 versions']
    },
    dist: {
        files: {
            'css/dist/styles.css': ['css/src/styles.css']
        }
    }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Example of css with flexbox:
{% codeblock lang:css %}
.column {
  display: flex;
}
{% endcodeblock %}

The resulting css generated by autoprefixer:
{% codeblock lang:css %}
.column {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: -moz-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
}
{% endcodeblock %}

You can modify which browsers are supported by changing the browser array.  For more documentation, check out the [github repo](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer).
